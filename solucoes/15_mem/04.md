## Problema

4 - Completa o código das funções `player_new()` e `player_destroy()`, que
inicializam e destroem um apontador para uma variável do tipo `PLAYER`,
respetivamente.

```c
/** Types of weapon. */
typedef enum { SWORD, DAGGER, AXE, MACE, PISTOL, MACHINEGUN, SHOTGUN,
    SNIPER_RIFLE, BFG9000, PLASMAGUN, NAILGUN, BBGUN, KNIFE, ROD, FLAMETHROWER,
    SLINGSHOT, SPEAR, LONGBOW, CROSSBOW, PIKE, GRENADE, MINE, GATLINGGUN,
    ASSAULT_RIFLE
} WEAPON;

/** Player structure. */
typedef struct {
    int id;           /**< Player ID.               */
    char *name;       /**< Player name.             */
    WEAPON *weapons;  /**< Array of player weapons. */
} PLAYER;

/**
 * @brief Create new player object.
 *
 * @param id The player ID.
 * @param name The player name. Must be copied to the player `name` field and
 * not be used directly.
 * @param num_weapons Number of weapons this player can hold at any given time.
 * @return A new player.
 * */
PLAYER *player_new(int id, char *name, int num_weapons) {
    /* ************ */
    /* Codigo aqui! */
    /* ************ */
}

/**
 * @brief Destroy a player object.
 *
 * @param player Player object to destroy.
 * */
void player_destroy(PLAYER *player) {
    /* ************ */
    /* Codigo aqui! */
    /* ************ */
}
```

## Solução

```c
/** Types of weapon. */
typedef enum { SWORD, DAGGER, AXE, MACE, PISTOL, MACHINEGUN, SHOTGUN,
    SNIPER_RIFLE, BFG9000, PLASMAGUN, NAILGUN, BBGUN, KNIFE, ROD, FLAMETHROWER,
    SLINGSHOT, SPEAR, LONGBOW, CROSSBOW, PIKE, GRENADE, MINE, GATLINGGUN,
    ASSAULT_RIFLE
} WEAPON;

/** Player structure. */
typedef struct {
    int id;           /**< Player ID.               */
    char *name;       /**< Player name.             */
    WEAPON *weapons;  /**< Array of player weapons. */
} PLAYER;

/**
 * @brief Create new player object.
 *
 * @param id The player ID.
 * @param name The player name. Must be copied to the player `name` field and
 * not be used directly.
 * @param num_weapons Number of weapons this player can hold at any given time.
 * @return A new player.
 * */
PLAYER *player_new(int id, char *name, int num_weapons) {
	PLAYER play = (PLAYER *) malloc(sizeof(PLAYER));
	play->id = id;
	/* Below we require the +1 because of '\0' at the end of the string */
	play->name = (char *) calloc(strlen(name) + 1, sizeof(char));
	strcpy(play->name, name);
	play->weapons = (WEAPON *) malloc(num_weapons * sizeof(WEAPON));
	return play;
}

/**
 * @brief Destroy a player object.
 *
 * @param player Player object to destroy.
 * */
void player_destroy(PLAYER *player)
{
	free(player->weapons);
	free(player->name);
	free(player);
}
```
